# unitroot

A Java library implementing the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test to check for unit roots. 

The core implementation is a port of the Fortran code referenced in:

James G. MacKinnon, "Numerical Distribution Functions for Unit Root and
Cointegration Tests", Journal of Applied Econometrics, Vol. 11, No. 6,
1996, pp. 601-618.

The Fortran source code is available here http://qed.econ.queensu.ca/pub/faculty/mackinnon/numdist/

The port has been validated somewhat through unit tests. The results produced by this Java port match the values generated by the program urcdist.exe for the inputs described in the paper. The values match the values generated by the Fortran version to at least 3 decimal places and up to 4 decimals places in some cases.

The port is available in the package io.datanapis.unitroot.distribution. The distribution data which the implementation relies on is part of the resources folder.

For ease of use, this version is wrapped in a simpler to use API - UnitRootEvaluator. However, this wrapper only provides an API to test for unit root. The core implementation can test for both unit roots and cointegration for up to 12 lags. The core implementation can also calculate the critical-value for a given confidence level.

The wrapper API and implementation is ported from the R-package fUnitRoots. Specifically, it is an implementation of the function unitrootTest.
